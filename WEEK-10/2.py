# 2. Write a Python program that imports specific functions  from the math module to  perform mathematical operations.
# Print the following results: 
# 1.   Calculate the square root of 16 using the sqrt() function. 
# 2.   Round up the value 4.4 to the nearest integer using the ceil() function. 
# 3.   Round down the value 4.4 to the nearest integer using the floor() function. 
# 4.   Calculate the factorial of 5 using the factorial() function.

import math as m
print(m.sqrt(16))
print(m.ceil(4.4))
print(m.floor(4.4))
print(m.factorial(5))
