# 3.Write a Python program that imports all functions and constants from the math module  to perform mathematical operations.
# Print the following results: 
# 1.   Calculate the square root of 16.
# 2.   Round up the value 4.4 to the nearest integer.  
# 3.   Round down the value 4.4 to the nearest integer.  
# 4.   Calculate the factorial of 5

import math as m
print(m.sqrt(16))
print(m.ceil(4.4))
print(m.floor(4.4))
print(m.factorial(5))
