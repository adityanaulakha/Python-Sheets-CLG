# 7.Area Of Ellipse 
#  Given the lengths of semi-major axis A and semi-minor axis B of an ellipse, calculate the  Area of the Ellipse. 
# Area of ellipse having semi-major axis length a and semi-minor axis length b is given by Ï€ *  a * b. 
# NOTE: Since, the answer can be a real number, you have to return the ceil value of the area. 
# Ceil value of a real number X is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to X
